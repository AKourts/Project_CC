#**Project in Cloud Computing**

#Description of the problem

Nowadays, knowing at least one foreign language is a must-have. However, there are people who do not know a foreign language because of various reasons:

- I hate learning foreign languages bro...
- I would like to learn but I cannot afford it...
- Hmm, I want to learn but I am afraid it is to hard...

This application is going to solve this problem once and forever.

#Solution

A fun application will help people around the world learn the basics of a new language by providing information like simple everyday phrases, a dictionary etc. 

#Architecture

- The solution will be based in microservices architecture.
- A NoSql DB will be used for this purpose.
- Python will be the main programming language.
- Flask is the selected framework.
- A public REST-API will be created.

#Plan

- Milestone 2: Provisioning of VM.
- Milestone 3: Orchestration of VM.
- Milestone 4: Use of containers.
- Milestone 5: Combination of the virtual infrastucture to deploy a concrete application.
